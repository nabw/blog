I have studied diverse topics regarding mathematical modeling of the human body and numerical methods to approximate these models numerically. Despite the first person conjugation used throughout this page, none of this would have been possible without the invaluable contribution of my colleagues. They are indeed my most precious asset, and I am deeply thankful for their work and contributions.

* Deformable Image Registration

Image registration consists in finding a mapping between two images. My studies were motivated by lung deformation, mostly because lungs being mechanically ventilated (due to decreased breathing capability) deform in an unnatural way which induces VILI (ventilation induced lung injury). In this area I contributed to the modeling of registration with prescribed stresses and its approximation with primal and mixed formulations.

* Cardiac poromechanics

Cardiac modeling loosely regards the development of mathematical models for the human heart. I helped in creating a computational framework to include blood flow in the myocardium into these models, tackling problems from both modeling and numerical perspectives.
