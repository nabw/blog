Welcome to my corner of the internet! Here I hope to keep things of my interest, intended in a very broad sense. I got my PhD degree at Politecnico di Milano, where I studied numerical methods for cardiac poromechanics. I am currently interested numerical modeling of the human body, specially in PDE models, and how to approximate those models on a computer. On the other side, I am also studying scalable numerical methods from a methodological point of view (_preconditioners_) and from a technical point of view (_use of GPU_). More information regarding my research can be found online in scientific journals, and also in the Research section here, where I will link preprints as well ~~to keep you from overloading SciHub~~.

I try to use open source software (FOSS) as much as possible. This means I have used Ubuntu for many years (after trying and failing with many others), I recently installed Lineage OS on my phone and open alternatives to all everyday programs: Matlab -> Octave, COMSOL -> FEniCS & deal.II, Word/Excel -> LibreOffice & LaTeX, GMail -> Email (from /e/), Chrome -> Brave, Google -> Qwant/DuckDuckGo, Facebook -> SlimSocial (wrapper only), Instagram -> Barinsta (wrapper only), Twitter -> Mastodon, Cloud -> Nextcloud (WIP), Whatsapp -> Telegram (WIP to convince everyone). I am currently failing with CUDA, but I try to use ROCm/HIP to at least keep compatibility between AMD (open source!) and NVIDIA (closed source...).

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
